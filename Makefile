# INSTUCTIONS FOR FIRST TIME USE (ON A COMPUTER YOU HAVEN'T USED BEFORE/FROM A NEW CLONED REPO)
# If you have already used this Makefile before ignore the instructions below. Just use it the normal way.
# 1) Type 'make', it will execute then run into an error. this is normal because the changes have not yet reflected on in the terminal.
# 2) Type 'source ~/.zshrc', this will refresh the terminal.
# 3) Type 'make', it will execute with the new terminal state and there should be no error.

# SOME PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER
# * Brew may take forever to install or update. Just press ctrl-c and start the procces again.

# WHERE TO PUT YOUR FILES (IT WON'T WORK IF THE FILES ARE IN THE WRONG PLACE)
# * Source files (*.cpp) must be put in the 'src' folder
# * Header files (*.hpp) must be put in the 'include' folder
